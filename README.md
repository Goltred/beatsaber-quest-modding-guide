# Introduction to Modding Beat Saber for Oculus Quest 

This guide is intended to serve as a starting point for writing your own mods for Beat Saber for Oculus Quest. The modding scene for Quest is fairly small and fast-moving, so certain tools, techniques, and best practices may quickly become outdated, and instructional guides can be hard to find. To successfully write mods you'll need to be at least a little bit scrappy and resourceful.

Certain assumptions are made, like that you are at least vaguely familiar with software development on Windows, and can navigate a terminal. Most resources have been created with this in mind. Windows is not a hard requirement, but tools and build scripts referenced here all expect it. Mods themselves are written in C++, and this guide does not aim to teach the language.

When in doubt, check out the [BSMG Discord #quest-mod-dev channel](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods), and try searching on Discord before asking questions. Browsing through source code of existing mods is another great way to familiarize yourself with coding patterns and practices.

## Prerequisites

### Oculus Quest setup

Beat Saber should already be modded with the latest [BMBF](https://bmbf.dev/stable), with Developer Mode enabled on your Quest. You should also have [SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com/setup-howto) installed on your computer, though if you've gotten BMBF installed without it then you likely do not need this guide.

**Tips and tricks**:
- To keep the Quest display from turning off when you remove it, you can place a piece of tape over the black sensor in the inside top-center of the headset, above the nose.
- Video can be streamed from your Quest to your computer through SideQuest to see the VR screen without putting the headset on.
- Wireless debugging can be enabled through SideQuest to develop without the Quest plugged in. This will quickly drain your battery and is not recommended.
- In development, you may want to use just a single controller and have extra AA batteries handy, since they'll spend a lot of time being on.


### Development environment

This guide assumes you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), however it's not a hard requirement and plenty of modders use other IDEs, though some steps in this guide may differ.

- [Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads) must be installed. Note its path for project template setup later.
- [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools#downloads) is strongly recommended and this guide assumes it is present in your `PATH`. It's necessary for running `adb` commands.
- [qpm (Quest Package Manager)](https://github.com/sc2ad/QuestPackageManager) is required and should be in your `PATH`. *Note*: qpm releases can be found by going to Actions on GitHub, to the latest build, and downloading the appropriate artifact for your system.


---

## Starting a new project

We will start from [Laurie's project template](https://github.com/Lauriethefish/quest-mod-template). It's made to use the VSCode [Project Templates extension by cantonios](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cantonios.project-templates).

- *(TODO: flesh this out)* Create template from zip, create project from template.
- Add your NDK path to `includePaths` in `.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json`, e.g. `"C:\path\to\ndk\**"`
- If you extracted a downloaded zip of the template, for each `.ps1` file, go to the file's Properties and check "Unblock" to avoid a confirmation prompty every time you run a script.
- Run `qpm restore`. This will download the dependencies defined in `qpm.json`. When you add or change a dependency, rerun the command. See [the qpm repository](https://github.com/sc2ad/QuestPackageManager) for more information on using qpm.
- Your mod requires a name for the library NDK will generate. Replace all references of `#{id}` in the all `.ps1` files with the name you want to give your library
  - *Note*: A simple name (no spaces, no special characters) is preferred for this ID since it will be able to be referenced better in different operative systems
- To run an initial test build, run `build.ps1`.
  - *Note*: The template includes references to a specific version of `beatsaber_hook` which qpm will likely download a newer version of. This initial build will fail and you'll need to change those versioned references, e.g. find and replace `beatsaber_hook_0_8_2` with `beatsaber_hook_0_8_4` (assuming `0_8_4` is the newest downloaded version)
- Once you get the build succeeding, congratulations! You've compiled a Beat Saber mod. 

**Tips and tricks**:
- Commands can be run from a PowerShell terminal inside VSCode (Terminal > New Terminal or Ctrl+Shift+\`)


---

## Build scripts

- `copy.ps1` will build the mod and copy it directly to your Quest's mods directory (`/sdcard/Android/data/com.beatgames.beatsaber/files/mods`)
  - (Re)start BeatSaber: `adb shell am start com.beatgames.beatsaber/com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayerActivity`
  - Realtime logs: `adb logcat QuestHook[#{id}|#{version}]:* *:S` (see [Logging](#logging))
- `build.ps1` will just build the mod (generates `.so` file) and nothing else. Not super useful outside of confirming code validity.
- `buildBMBF.ps1` will build the mod and package it into a `.zip` that can be installed via BMBF. Once you are ready to share the mod with others, this is the thing you distribute.

---

## Hooks

Hooks are the primary way of interfacing with the game. You find a method that the game calls, and run some of your code whenever that method is called. The hooks themselves are written in two parts. First, you create the hook using `MAKE_OFFSET_HOOKLESS`, then you install the hook at load-time using `INSTALL_HOOK_OFFSETLESS`.

`MAKE_OFFSET_HOOKLESS` takes the args: `hook_name, return_type, ...args`, where `hook_name` is whatever you want it to be, `return_type` is the actual type that the original function returns, and `...args` is all of the arguments passed to the original method. When hooking an instance method, the first argument will always be a pointer to the class instance itself, and this self-reference is _not_ included in the number of args specified when installing the hook.

Hooks effectively replace the original function call, so you generally need to call the original function at some point in your hook. In `void` functions, you'll *usually* call this at the start (though if you're overriding values then you'll necessarily call it later):
```c++
MAKE_OFFSET_HOOKLESS(MyHook, void, Il2CppObject* self, SomeType arg1, SomeType arg2) {
  MyHook(self, arg1, arg2);
  /* your code here */
}
```

In functions that return a value, you'll want to make sure to return the original value at the end:
```c++
MAKE_OFFSET_HOOKLESS(MyHook, int, Il2CppObject* self, SomeType arg1, SomeType arg2) {
  // either option A: retrieve the value and return it later
  int original_value = MyHook(self, arg1, arg2);
  /* your code here */
  return original_value;

  // or option B: just return the original value directly
  /* your code here */
  return MyHook(self, arg1, arg2);
}
```

`INSTALL_HOOK_OFFSETLESS` is where you install your hook code to the correct place using `il2cpp`, so that it runs when it's supposed to. For this, you'll need to know the call path to the method, and the number of arguments it takes. If you want to hook `SomeClass::SomeMethod` which takes two args, then it'd look like this:
```c++
INSTALL_HOOK_OFFSETLESS(MyHook, il2cpp_utils::FindMethodUnsafe("", "SomeClass", "SomeMethod", 2))
```

As an example to put these together, let's say you want to a hook a method in the `Foo` class called `SomeMethod` that returns a `float` and takes one `char*` argument:
```c++
MAKE_OFFSET_HOOKLESS(MyHook, float, Il2CppObject* self, char* some_arg) {
  /* do something */
  return MyHook(self, some_arg);
}
extern "C" void load() {
  INSTALL_HOOK_OFFSETLESS(MyHook, il2cpp_utils::FindMethodUnsafe("", "Foo", "SomeMethod", 1));
}
```

**Important note**: Mistakes in hook definitions and installation are a *very* common source of issues and crashes. If your game crashes on startup after creating a new hook, double (and triple!) check that everything is correct, including the class name, method name, number of arguments (surprisingly easy to miscount), and the function signature of the hook itself.


### Finding methods to hook

In order to search through the game's code, you need the game's DLLs (unless searching through codegen headers, as described in the latter part of this section). Both the PC and Quest versions of the game can provide these DLLs, but only those of the PC version will decompile into fully traceable code. The Quest DLLs are quite usable, but you'll have more of a guess-and-check development process as they are effectively just headers.

If you *are* using PC sources, you may want to double check that the methods you're working on are actually present in the Quest version, either by dumping them as well or by checking the codegen headers. Most, but not all, of the function signatures are identical between the two.


#### Dumping DLLs from the Quest

The process of getting the code off your Quest is basically to dump the APK, extract some files from it, and dump DLLs out of them.

- *Get the Beat Saber APK*: From SideQuest, go to "Currently Installed Apps", click the cog icon next to Beat Saber, and then click "Backup APK file".
- *Extract from APK*: Use an archive tool such as [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) to extract `lib/arm64-v8a/libil2cpp.so` and `assets/bin/Data/Managed/Metadata/global-metadata.dat` from the APK.
- *Dump DLLs*: Run [il2CppDumper](https://github.com/Perfare/Il2CppDumper) and select the two files from the previous step. This will generate numerous DLLs into a `DummyDll` directory.


#### Browsing Quest or PC DLLs using dnSpy

Once you have your sources, whether from PC or Quest, it's time to fire up [dnSpy](https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy) to browse through them. Most of the relevant game code can be found in `Main.dll`, though there are also Unity libraries worth taking a look at. You can open multiple sources at a time into dnSpy and search through all of them simultaneously.

![dnSpy usage example](dnSpy-example.png)
*dnSpy can be used to browse or search through game classes and methods. These signatures are needed to properly hook methods. With PC DLLs, the method bodies will be present, while dumped Quest DLLs will have stubs.*


#### Browsing codegen headers

Instead of dumping the code yourself, one alternative is to search through what's available in the `codegen` Quest package, which is a core library on BMBF and thus available to all users automatically. This library is a set of headers generated via basically the same method as previously described ([Dumping DLLs from the Quest](#dumping-dlls-from-the-quest)), so either method works well as a source of truth.

- Add `codegen` as a dependency: `qpm dependency add "codegen"`, then run `qpm restore` to download it.
- Use your IDE to search through the codegen headers to find hookable methods.

![Searching through codegen headers using VSCode](vscode-codegen-example.png)
*Searching through codegen headers can be quite effective, and will provide the same function signatures as dnSpy.*

## Basic examples

With a basic understanding of what's going on, let's walk through a few examples of simple modding operations so that you can make some changes to the game and see your efforts in action. Along the way, you'll encounter some new concepts that might not be elaborated on - you should be well-equipped enough from here to investigate those on your own.


### Modifying a menu

In this walkthrough, we'll modify the main menu and change the text on one of its options.

*TODO: write the thing*


### Modifying a gameplay attribute

In this walkthrough, we'll modify gameplay by decreasing note jump speed. Begin by creating a new project from the mod template (as described in [Starting a new project](#starting-a-new-project))

Let's start out by searching for "note jump speed" with dnSpy. There are quite a few results. In order to find which is the right method to hook,  you'll need a bit of intuition, maybe to dig through methods (especially if you have PC DLLs), and possibly to write some code to hook a bunch of different methods and log out when they are called.

Eventually you'll come across the `BeatmapObjectSpawnMovementData` class. If you inspect its `Update` method, it appears to use `this._startNoteJumpMovementSpeed` to calculate the actual NJS, and that property is set in the `Init` method. You can see the whole signature here, so it's time to write a little hook:

```c++
MAKE_HOOK_OFFSETLESS(BeatmapObjectSpawnMovementData_Init, void,
  Il2CppObject* self,
  int noteLinesCount,
  float startNoteJumpMovementSpeed,
  float startBpm,
  float noteJumpStartBeatOffset,
  float jumpOffsetY,
  Vector3 rightVec,
  Vector3 forwardVec
) {
  BeatmapObjectSpawnMovementData_Init(self, noteLinesCount, startNoteJumpMovementSpeed, startBpm, noteJumpStartBeatOffset, jumpOffsetY, rightVec, forwardVec);
  getLogger().info(
    "BeatmapObjectSpawnMovementData_Init called. " + 
    "startNoteJumpMovementSpeed is: " + std::to_string(startNoteJumpMovementSpeed)
  );
}

extern "C" void load() {
    il2cpp_functions::Init();
    getLogger().info("Installing hooks...");
    INSTALL_HOOK_OFFSETLESS(
      BeatmapObjectSpawnMovementData_Init, 
      il2cpp_utils::FindMethodUnsafe("", "BeatmapObjectSpawnMovementData", "Init", 7)
    );
    getLogger().info("Installed all hooks!");
}
```

Now, if you run `copy.ps1` to build this and load it into your game, then start playing a song, you should see something like this logged just before the song loads in:
```
BeatmapObjectSpawnMovementData_Init called. startNoteJumpMovementSpeed is: 17.000000
```

All you need to do now is modify the value of `startNoteJumpSpeed` being passed to the original method in the hook. Try passing `startNoteJumpSpeed * 2.0f` or `startNoteJumpSpeed / 0.5f` and see what happens!

## Going further

With your environment setup and a basic understanding of hooks, you're well on your way to proficiency writing mods. Spend some time exploring the game's methods and where they're called. If you get stuck and can't Google your way out of it, try asking in #quest-mod-dev on the BSMG Discord.


### Logging

Make liberal use of logs to debug when calls are happening and why crashes are occurring. Logs can be viewed in realtime using `adb logcat`. To view logs only for your mod, filter for `QuestHook[$mod_id|v$mod_version]:*`. To view crash logs, `AndroidRuntime:E`.

So, to view logs specifically for your mod, and any crashes (that you probably caused! 😂):

```adb logcat QuestHook[my_mod|v0.1.0]:* AndroidRuntime:E *:S```

For broader (but not spammy) logging, consider also watching other tags related to mod loading. These logs can help diagnose a broader set of issues than just log lines you have explicitly written yourself:

```adb logcat main-modloader:* libmain-patched:* QuestHook:* AndroidRuntime:E *:S```

You can also pipe logcat to a file to generate dumps which may be helpful in having someone else help you.


### Sharing and distribution

When you're ready to share your work, package it into an installable zip file with `buildBMBF.ps1` and share it with the world!

- Share it in #quest-mods on the [BSMG Discord](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods)
- Submit your mod to [QuestBoard](https://questboard.xyz) via the [QuestBoard Hub Submission Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScT0pGWOIcifDALjuuefF7L9JgcH5epUaCcDj228DSs3KIyHg/viewform)
